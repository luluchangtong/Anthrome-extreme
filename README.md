By Lu Yin July 2022 (Utrecht University, Netherlands)

Here I provide some Python scripts used in my master thesis 'Global Anthrome Exposure to Extreme Heat in the Future'. This thesis will be published later.
Included scripts show:
1. Calculation of daily Wet bulb globe temperature(WBGT) using five climate forcing datasets (GFDL-ESM4, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MRI-ESM2-0, UKESM1-0-LL).
2. Estimation of frequency and area influenced by extreme heat for Anthrome, human health and four crops (maize, rice, soybean, wheat).
3. Data visualization

Abstract
-
Under the context of global warming, the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events will increase in the future as well, threatening the terrestrial system, human health, and food security. Now there is not sufficient research conducting comprehensive investigations of extreme heat on the land system. Therefore, this research made efforts to fill the gap by applying relative (anthrome) and absolute (human, crop) extreme heat thresholds to three future scenarios (ssp126, ssp370, and ssp585), quantifying the extreme heat events in the future. For the period before 2050, the frequency of extreme heat events of all anthrome has similar increasing trend, and after 2050, the frequency of ssp126 remains stable while the other two scenarios continue to increase at the end of the 21st century. For the area influenced by extreme heat, 2060 is a signal for ssp370 and ssp585, indicating that all anthromes will experience more frequent extreme heat than present since 2060. The frequency of extreme heat will mainly take place in tropic and subtropic regions and population exposure response to different future scenarios make obvious differences due to the interaction between climate change, land-use change, and population growth. The frequency of extreme heat events for major crops increases more or less, where rice 1 will be most affected and winter wheat will be least influenced. At present, 70% area of all crops does not experience extreme heat while more than 60% of cropsâ€™ planting area will be affected by extreme heat in ssp370 and ssp585 except for winter wheat. Therefore, it is of vital importance to develop relevant climate adaptation and mitigation strategies to cope with more frequent and intensive extreme heat events in the future.
