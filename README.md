Here I provide some Python scripts used in my master thesis 'Global Anthrome Exposure to Extreme Heat in the Future'. This thesis will be published later.
Included scripts show:
1. Calculation of daily Wet bulb globe temperature(WBGT) using five climate forcing datasets (GFDL-ESM4, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MRI-ESM2-0, UKESM1-0-LL).
2. Estimation of frequency and area influenced by extreme heat for Anthrome, human health and four crops (maize, rice, soybean, wheat).
3. Data visualization

Abstract
-
Under the context of global warming, the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events will increase in the future, threatening the terrestrial system. This research made efforts to estimate the frequency and influenced area of extreme heat in three future scenarios (ssp126, ssp370 and ssp585) regarding anthrome, human health and 4 major crops(maize, wheat, rice and soybean). 

For anthrome, we used the relative threshold (90th percentile) method, and our result suggested that the frequency of extreme heat of all anthrome has a similar increasing trend before 2050 in those three future scenarios. For the next coming periods, the extreme days and areas with more extreme heat remain stable in ssp126 while ssp370 and sssp585 keep increasing in frequency and area with more extreme heat. 2060 is a signal, indicating that all anthromes experience more extreme heat events than the present in ssp370 and ssp585. At the end of the 21st century, The extreme heat days for most anthromes double in ssp126 compared with that of the present, while ssp370 and ssp585 have similar results that extreme heat days increase more than three times

For the human health part, we adopted the wet bulb globe temperature method to quantify population exposure to extreme heat in the future. Extreme heat frequency will mainly occur in tropic and subtropic regions. Population exposed to extreme heat remains stable from 2015 to 2050 for most anthromes in all future scenarios. Then population exposure to heat in ssp126 decreased slightly while it increased quickly in ssp370 and ssp585. For most high population density anthromes, population exposure in ssp126 to heat is close to that of the present at the end of the 21st century. In ssp370 and ssp585, 23%-72% population in different anthromes were exposed to heat. 

The daily average temperature was used for the crop part to count extreme heat days. In ssp126, extreme heat days nearly doubled for most crops, while in ssp370 and ssp585, extreme heat days increased much faster than in ssp126. Especially in ssp585, the extreme heat days increased more than 10 times for most crops, indicating that crops would face poor growing conditions in such an extreme scenario. Among those crops, rice was most influenced by extreme heat, while wheat was least influenced. And there was no significant difference between irrigation and rainfed systems. In general, the more frequent extreme heat in the future will threaten our land system, human health and food security. More attention and mitigation or adaptation strategies are needed to cope with the extreme heat crisis in the future.
